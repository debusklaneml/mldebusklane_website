I am a researcher, aviator, father, husband, and one who easily gets lost in figuring out just about anything.

My research focuses on writing self-efficacy and feedback, emotional reactivity, working memory, and various other musings such as creativity and intelligence in the student population. I am also deeply interested in unique quantitative methods, mixtures models, measurement design, machine learning, and longitudinal growth.

I am currently employed as an educational researcher at a large school division in Virginia. I mainly wrangle data (#rstats), provide predictive analytics to optimize student success with unique groupings and machine learning, and help manage our data-warehouse that provides practitioners with vital data analytics to enable them to make data informed decisions.
